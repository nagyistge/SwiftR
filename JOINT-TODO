SHORT-TERM GOALS
---------------
* Stable on the following platforms:
    - SGE
    - Local multi-core
    - PBS
    - SSH
* Working on the following platforms for development use:
    - Cobalt
    - Slurm
* Speed competitive with Snowfall on basic tasks


TEST SUITE
-----------
1. get and try openmx examples
2. look at openmx test examples for test structure conventions
3. Test cleanup
4. performance tests (compare with Snowfall)
    - vary durations, batching, and target environs
    - vary input and output sizes
    - plot performance surfaces


MANUAL TESTING
--------------
1. test on local, ssh, pbs (then SGE)
    - need SGE accounts for Tim
2. test fast branch

PERFORMANCE OPTIMISATION
------------------------
1. increase speed on basic per tests

ARCHITECTURAL CHANGES
--------------------------
1. add readSocket/writeSocket function to swift
2. replace clienr-R-to-rserver.swift fifo with socket
3. replace worker.pl-to-appScript.sh-to-serverR fifo with socket (later?)
4.  consider karajan instead of swift program (discuss w/ Mihael and Allan)

MISC SWIFTR ISSUES
------------------
* replace ack with fprintf

MISC SWIFT ISSUES
----------
- coaster service & worker timeout - disable
- use fprintf()
- test fast branch
- eval raw swift and worker speed


BACKGROUND - TIM
----------------
1. Read OpenMX Paper, Wiki

ADMIN - TIM
----------
* SGE accounts
    -Get acct on IBI cluster - ci support
    - apply for TeraGrid account to test on Ranger SGE system
    - Eureka account
